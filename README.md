# Dyna-Child-Theme

This is a starter child theme for Dyna. Visit the main repo here: https://github.com/dyna-press/dyna

This is work in progress, but you may start developing with Dyna and Dyna Child. 

Install the Dyna Theme, check the white page and install Dyna Child, see how the site looks inverted. There are only a few styles that do this job. Check style.css to do your own changes.

Check functions.php. We left some code there to help you loading own CSS and JS.

Check index.php. There is a sidebar loaded before footer. Change or delete it, when it hurts your eyes.

Happy Hacking ;-)
